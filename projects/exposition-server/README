                    How to use the Exposition PHP Server
=============================================================================

INTRODUCTION
------------

The role of the widget server is to provide different ways to render widgets.
For instance, the widget server can render widgets in standalone mode or within
iframes.


INSTALL
-------

1. You need a local web server and PHP 5.2 available. Mac OS and most Linux
   distributions now come with Apache and PHP, but you can set up your own
   environment. If you are a Windows user, you may download a all-in-one package
   like EasyPHP or WAMP5.

2. To set up the Exposition widget server, copy the files from your archive to
   your web root. You can also create a virtual host linking to the root of the
   Exposition package.

3. This application requires that you either have Zend Framework on your
   include_path, or that you will be symlinking your Zend Framework library
   into the library directory. If you do not yet have Zend Framework, you
   can get it from one of the following sources:

      * Official Release:
        http://framework.zend.com/dowload/latest

      * Using Subversion; use either the current trunk or the 1.9.2 release branch:
        svn co http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend
        svn co http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/branches/release-1.9.2/library/Zend

      * Using Git; use either the current trunk or the 1.9.2 release branch:
        git clone http://tjohns.net/git/zf.git
        git fetch
        git checkout --track -b release-1.9.2 origin/tags/release-1.9.2

4. Test the Exposition widget server at the following URL:
   http://<host>/widget/frame?uwaUrl=<uwa-widget-url>
   For example, the URL to render a RSS Reader widget within in iframe is:
   http://<host>/widget/frame?uwaUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.netvibes.com%2Fapi%2Fuwa%2Fexamples%2Frssreader.html

If you cannot see the widget, make sure that your web server is configured
to read .htaccess files and that URL rewriting is enabled.


USAGE
-----

Below is the list of the available features of the Exposition widget server.

1. Widget: http://<host>/widget/<action>?uwaUrl=<uwa-widget-url>,
   where <action> can be one of the following:
    - uwa:   renders a widget in standalone mode with XML well-formedness
    - frame: renders a widget for iframe display
    - js:    renders the JavaScript controller of a widget
    - css:   renders the CSS styles of a widget

2. Proxy: http://<host>/proxy/<action>?url=<url>&type=<type>
   where <action> can be one of the following:
    - ajax:  handles Ajax calls, where <type> can be either 'text', 'xml', or 'json'
    - feed:  handles Ajax calls for feeds and returns a JSON output


SECURITY NOTICE
---------------

For security purpose, it is highly recommended to install the Exposition widget
server on a dedicated domain or subdomain. If possible, it is even better to put
each widget iframe on a different subdomain (e.g. with an auto-generated number).
It would prevent the iframes from communicating directly with each other or
accessing your parent container.
