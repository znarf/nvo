                    How to use the Exposition PHP Server
=============================================================================

INTRODUCTION
------------

The role of the widget server is to provide different ways to render widgets.
For instance, the widget server can render widgets in standalone mode or within
iframes.


INSTALL
-------

1. You need a local web server and PHP 5.2 available. Mac OS and most Linux 
   distributions now come with Apache and PHP, but you can set up your own 
   environment. If you are a Windows user, you may download a all-in-one package
   like EasyPHP or WAMP5.

2. To set up the Exposition widget server, copy the files from your archive to 
   your web root. You can also create a virtual host linking to the root of the
   Exposition package.

3. Test the Exposition widget server at the following URL:
   http://<host>/public/widget/frame?uwaUrl=<uwa-widget-url>
   For example, the URL to render a RSS Reader widget within in iframe is:
   http://<host>/public/widget/frame?uwaUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.netvibes.com%2Fapi%2Fuwa%2Fexamples%2Frssreader.html

If you cannot see the widget, make sure that your web server is configured
to read .htaccess files and that URL rewriting is enabled.


USAGE
-----

Below is the list of the available features of the Exposition widget server.

1. Widget: http://<host>/public/widget/<action>?uwaUrl=<uwa-widget-url>,
   where <action> can be one of the following:
    - uwa:   renders a widget in standalone mode with XML well-formedness
    - frame: renders a widget for iframe display
    - js:    renders the JavaScript controller of a widget
    - css:   renders the CSS styles of a widget

2. Proxy: http://<host>/public/proxy/<action>?url=<url>&type=<type>
   where <action> can be one of the following:
    - ajax:  handles Ajax calls, where <type> can be either 'text', 'xml', or 'json'
    - feed:  handles Ajax calls for feeds and returns a JSON output


SECURITY NOTICE
---------------

For security purpose, it is highly recommended to install the Exposition widget
server on a dedicated domain or subdomain. If possible, it is even better to put
each widget iframe on a different subdomain (e.g. with an auto-generated number).
It would prevent the iframes from communicating directly with each other or
accessing your parent container.
